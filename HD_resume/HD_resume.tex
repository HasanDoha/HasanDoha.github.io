Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials have triggered enormous interest since their emergence. 2D materials having puckered hexagonal honeycomb structure are intrinsically anisotropic. In the hexagonal honeycomb structure, there are two different atomic configurations along the two different directions- zigzag and armchair. A flat honeycomb structure is anisotropic only at edges. In puckered hexagonal honeycomb structure, because of these different atomic configurations, these materials demonstrate anisotropy in electrical, optical and thermal conductivity. Because of these anisotropic properties, these layered 2D materials are promising candidates for modern electronic and optoelectronic devices. My focus is on the experimental investigation of the properties of anisotropic 2D materials.
